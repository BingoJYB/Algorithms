'''
    Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of
    a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
    permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just
    dictionary words.
    EXAMPLE
    Input: Tact Coa
    Output: True (permutations: "taco cat'; "atc o etaÂ·; etc.)
